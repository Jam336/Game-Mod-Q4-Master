Bosses- There are three bosses in the game can be summoned by doing the command boss [1-3], which will restart combat with the relative boss
1-Itemmie,the item boss. Itemmie is a little stupid and uses whatever item the player just used targeting the player, if the player hasn't used an item, they'll simply lob a grenade at them.
2-Helen, the healer. Helen heals herself and her allies during combat, keeping the player from finishing the fight quickly (and even reviving them after death!)
3-ZORGAX RISER OF CORPSES. Zorgac RISER OF CORPSES, is a necromancer. Should an ally fall in battle, Zorgax forces them to fight on, having their dead ally make 2 attacks instead of one, effectively doubling their damage!
